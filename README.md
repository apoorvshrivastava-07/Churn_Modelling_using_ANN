# Churn_Modelling_using_ANN
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computer system inspired by biological neural networks for creating artificial brains based on the collection of connected units called artificial neurons. It is designed to analyse and process information as humans. Artificial Neural Network has self-learning capabilities to produce better results as more data is available. Here I have tried build churn model using ANN
